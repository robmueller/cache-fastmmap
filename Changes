Revision history for Perl extension Cache::FastMmap.

1.40 Mon Dec 5  10:30 2011
  - Work around reference holding bug in
     Compress::Zlib

1.39 Mon Jul 18 09:50 2011
  - Remove CImpl and simplify structure into just
     Cache::FastMmap module making all XS calls
     just function calls in Cache::FastMmap
     namespace

1.38 Sun Jul 17 18:30 2011
  - Fix build process that was completely broken
     after moving files around into different
     directories

1.37 Fri Jul 15 16:30 2011
  - Use a lock object with DESTROY method to avoid
     an alarm with a die leaving around a locked
     paged

1.36 Wed Sep 29 13:10 2010
  - Disable wrapping fcntl() lock call in alarm, hurts
     people that use Time::HiRes::alarm() only to try
     and catch buggy deadlock code. Enable with
     catch_deadlocks option

1.35 Fri Feb 19 12:45 2010
  - Fix for returning potential bug that returns old stored
     data. Could occur if you mix deletes
     (thanks Darrell Bishop)

1.34 Fri Jun 19 12:00 2009
  - perldoc fix (thanks Jonathan Yu)

1.33 Thu Jun 18 12:00 2009
  - Update version in META.yml

1.32 Thu Jun 18 11:55 2009
  - Better LiveCaches tracking via DESTROY

1.31 Thu Jun 18 11:40 2009
  - when in raw_values => 0 mode, the write_cb is now
    correctly called with thawed data, rather than the
    raw frozen data
  - empty_on_exit correctly called even when a global
    cache is left at interpreter exit time (required
    Scalar::Util qw(weaken) for object tracking)

1.30 Fri May 8  11:10 2009
  - Fix for Mandriva compiler (thanks Jean-Christian Hassler)

1.29 Fri May 1  17:20 2009

     if called in list context

1.27  Wed Jun 18 17:15 2008
  - Fix non-ansi C code
  - Remove debug flags

1.26  Thu May 22 14:50 2008

      thanks to Sam Vilain

1.25  Mon Feb 04 13:20 2008
  - Fix multi_set bug and add test
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32895)
  - Test share_file is not a reference
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32252)
  - Fix C variable declaration error
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=31223)

     to the above bugs

1.24  Mon Oct 22 13:15 2007
  - Add atomic get_and_remove() method thanks to
      Darrell Bishop

1.23  Wed Oct 17 16:00 2007
  - Fix expire time parsing

1.22  Wed Oct 17 14:05 2007
  - If third parameter to set() is not a references, treat it as
    a specify expiry time. Increases compatiability with
    Cache::Cache API. Helpful for Catalyst framework

1.21  Tue Oct 16 10:40 2007
  - if first parameter to new() is a hash ref, use it as
     the options hash. Helpful for Catalyst framework

1.20  Thu Oct 2 13:40 2007
  - add to documentation about page size and cache file locations
  - fix t/6.t test failure under new Test::More

1.19  Thu Aug 23 09:03 2007
  - bad C declaration crept in again, now in svn

1.18  Thu Aug 22 17:30 2007
  - fix use of $^O not to catch "darwin"
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28330)

1.17  Thu Aug 22 17:14 2007
  - fix declaration in C code that wasn't legal C

1.16  Thu May 8 17:12 2007
  - fix typo in Changes file (1.15 is 2007, not 2006)
  - fix get_keys(2) when undef values in cache
  - fix some leak detection tests

1.15  Thu May 8 17:12 2007
  - catch and rethrow die/exceptions in get_and_set() callbacks
  - avoid undef warnings when using cache_not_found mode
  - use unique tempfile name rather than the same every time
  - add allow_recursive option to allow calls to cache
    from within a read/write callback sub
  - add checks to die if we try and lock a cache twice,
    rather than just causing mysterious errors
  - add unlink_on_exit to automatically delete the share_file
    when the cache exits. default to true if we created
    the share_file, false if we connected to an existing one
  - make empty_on_exit only call empty if the pid of the
    process we're cleaning up in is the same as the pid we
    were created in
  - die in CLONE, making it clear threads aren't supported

1.14  Thu Oct 20 11:45 2006
  - alter calc_expunge to allow more efficient alternate
    implementation cases

1.13  Thu Oct 20 11:15 2006
  - mention UNIX/Win32 compatiability in docs
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16501)
  - detect page corruption better and croak rather than segfault
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=17335)
  - when running in raw_values => 0 mode, always store
    reference to data. Storable doesn't like freeze(SCALAR)
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16762)
  - Handle edge case of slot count increase when page
    already nearly full possibly causing corruption
    (can only happen if ->purge() called at just the wrong time)

1.12  Thu Oct 19 09:50 2006
  - allow writing into a deleted slot

1.11  Web Oct 18 15:10 2006
  - allow setting default slot count via start_slots argument

1.10  Web Oct 18 14:50 2006
  - fc_lock() would segfault if no slots were available.
    Doesn't happen in normal usage, but can happen if
    cache behaviour altered by alternate code

1.09  Thu Feb  7 15:50 2005
  - add get_and_set() routine to allow atomic reading and
    writing of a cache value (thanks to Sreeji Das)
