 * DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * This class implements a shared memory cache through an mmap'ed file. It
 * uses locking to ensure multiple processes can safely access the cache
 * at the same time. It uses a basic LRU algorithm to keep the most used
 * entries in the cache.
 * 
 * It tries to be quite efficient through a number of means:
 * 
 * It uses multiple pages within a file, and uses Fcntl to only lock
 * a page at a time to reduce contention when multiple processes access
 * the cache.
 * 
 * It uses a dual level hashing system (hash to find page, then hash
 * within each page to find a slot) to make most I<read> calls O(1) and
 * fast
 * 
 * On each I<write>, if there are slots and page space available, only
 * the slot has to be updated and the data written at the end of the used
 * data space. If either runs out, a re-organisation of the page is
 * performed to create new slots/space which is done in an efficient way
 * 
 * The locking is explicitly done in the C interface, so you can create
 * a 'read_many' or 'write_many' function that reduces the number of
 * locks required
 * 
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION
 * 
 * Each file is made up of a number of 'pages'. The number of
 * pages and size of each page is specified when the class is
 * constructed. These values are stored in the cache class
 * and must be the same for each class connecting to the cache
 * file.
 * 
 * NumPages - Number of 'pages' in the cache
 * PageSize - Size of each 'page' in the cache
 * 
 * The layout of each page is:
 * 
 * - Magic (8 bytes) - 0x92f7e3b17d937a12 magic page start marker
 *
 * - NumSlots (8 bytes) - Number of hash slots in this page
 *
 * - FreeSlots (8 bytes) - Number of free slots left in this page.
 *   This includes all slots with a last access time of 0
 *   (empty and don't search past) or 1 (empty, but keep searching
 *   because deleted slot)
 * 
 * - OldSlots (8 bytes) - Of all the free slots, how many were in use
 *   and are now deleted. This is slots with a last access time of 1
 * 
 * - FreeData (8 bytes) - Offset to free data area to place next item
 * 
 * - FreeBytes (8 bytes) - Bytes left in free data area
 * 
 * - N Reads (8 bytes) - Number of reads performed on this page
 *
 * - N Read Hits (8 bytes) - Number of reads on this page that have hit
 *   something in the cache
 * 
 * - Slots (8 bytes * NumSlots) - Hash slots
 *
 * - Data (to end of page) - Key/value data
 * 
 * Each slot is made of:
 * 
 * - Offset (8 bytes) - offset from start of page to actual data. This
 *   is 0 if slot is empty, 1 if was used but now empty. This is needed
 *   so deletes don't require a complete rehash with the linear
 *   searching method we use
 *
 * Each data item is made of:
 *
 * - LastAccess (8 bytes) - Unix time data was last accessed
 * 
 * - ExpireTime (8 bytes) - Unix time data should expire. This is 0 if it
 *   should never expire
 * 
 * - HashValue (8 bytes) - Value key was hashed to, so we don't have to
 *   rehash on a re-organisation of the hash table
 *
 * - Flags (8 bytes) - Various flags
 * 
 * - KeyLen (8 bytes) - Length of key
 * 
 * - ValueLen (8 bytes) - Length of value
 * 
 * - Key (KeyLen bytes) - Key data
 * 
 * - Value (ValueLen bytes) - Value data
 * 
 * Each set/get/delete operation involves:
 * 
 * - Find the page for the key
 * - Lock the page
 * - Read the page header
 * - Find the hash slot for the key
 * 
 * For get's:
 * 
 * - Use linear probing to find correct key, or empty slot
 * 
 * For set's:
 * 
 * - Use linear probing to find empty slot
 * - If not enough free slots, do an 'expunge' run
 * - Store key/value at FreeData offset, update, and store in slot
 * - If not enough space at FreeData offset, do an 'expunge' run
 *    then store data
 * 
 * For delete's:
 * 
 * - Use linear probing to find correct key, or empty slot
 * - Set slot to empty (data cleaned up in expunge run)
 * 
 * An expunge run consists of:
 * 
 * - Scan slots to find used key/value parts. Remove older items
 * - If ratio used/free slots too high, increase slot count
 * - Compact key/value data into one memory block
 * - Restore and update offsets in slots
